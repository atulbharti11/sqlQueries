1. DELETE :
Basically, it is a Data Manipulation Language Command (DML). 
It is use to delete the one or more tuples of a table. 
With the help of “DELETE” command we can either delete all the rows in one go or can delete row one by one. 
i.e., we can use it as per the requirement or the condition using Where clause. 
It is comparatively slower than TRUNCATE cmd.

    SYNTAX –
    If we want to delete all the rows of the table:
    DELETE from ; 

    SYNTAX –
    If we want to delete the row of the table as per the condition then we use WHERE clause,
    DELETE from  WHERE  ; 

Note –
Here we can use the “ROLLBACK” command to restore the tuple.

2. DROP :
It is a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). 
It is use to drop the whole table. With the help of “DROP” command we can drop (delete) the whole structure in one go
i.e. it removes the named elements of the schema. 
By using this command the existence of the whole table is finished or say lost.

    SYNTAX –
    If we want to drop the table:
    DROP table ;  

Note –
Here we can’t restore the table by using the “ROLLBACK” command.

3. TRUNCATE :
It is also a Data Definition Language Command (DDL). 
It is use to delete all the rows of a relation (table) in one go.
With the help of “TRUNCATE” command we can’t delete the single row as here WHERE clause is not used. 
By using this command the existence of all the rows of the table is lost. 
It is comparatively faster than delete command as it deletes all the rows fastly.

    SYNTAX –
    If we want to use truncate :
    TRUNCATE  ;  

Note –
Here we can’t restore the tuples of the table by using the “ROLLBACK” command.
